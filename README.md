I would use a recursion to replace each line segment with four smaller ones, creating the fractal. The process for me would starr with an equilateral triangle. At each recusrsive step, each line segment is replaced by two new segments forming an outward pointing bump if you will. To calculate the bump, you find the endpoints of the middle third and use a rotation function of some sort to calculate the apex. If i had to guess I would probably rotate it by 60 degrees. The original segment is then replaced with four smaller sgements. The recursion stops when a base caase is reached, which would be when the depth reaches zero or the lime segment becomes shorter than a specefied length
